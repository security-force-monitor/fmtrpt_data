# Notes: 2000-2001 FMT report

This report does not contain the information that we are looking for, and nor does the year previous. So we won't parse out this time.

## Sources

This report is in three different PDFs, listed on the report's [landing page](https://www.state.gov/t/pm/rls/rpt/fmtrpt/2001/3121.htm):

 * Africa, Asia and Pacific: http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/3164.pdf
 * Europe, Near East, and Newly Independent States: http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/3165.pdf
 * South Asia, Western Hemisphere: http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/3166.pdf

Download these and plonk them in the input directory.

The report is not available in a single PDF.

## Issues encountered

### List of problems in the 2000-2001 PDFs

- For future reference these PDfs do not contain the unit information that we seek.
- The PDFs are also columnar, which will require some additional configuration of pdftohtml to define specific regions to parse data from. We don't have to do this in this run though.
